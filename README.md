# WirecutterDailyHeadline

Welcome to WirecutterDailyHeadline! This basic CLI allows you, the user, to read The Wirecutter's
headline of the day from the comfort of your Terminal!  Light readers can quickly skim through a summary of the article, while more diehard fans can delve into the nitty-gritty and peruse the
extensive research that The Wirecutter puts into writing each review.  Want to see pictures of, or perhaps buy one of the products?  Or maybe you simply want to read more product reviews from The Wirecutter?  WirecutterDailyHeadline can open the article in your default Internet browser, where you can fall down a Wirecutter Hole at your leisure!  (I take no responsibility for any spontaneous purchases you make while doing so.)

All data is scraped directly from The Wirecutter's website using Nokogiri.

(I am not affiliated with The Wirecutter in any way; I'm merely a fan of their work who needed to build a gem for a school assignment, but I plan to build it out as I learn more!)

UPDATED 5/23/18 - I've made some minor changes here and there to catch missing data, but for a cleaned up and refactored version of this gem, check out the "flatiron-assessment" branch.  It runs exactly the same, but with fewer lines of code!   

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wirecutter_daily_headline'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wirecutter_daily_headline

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
